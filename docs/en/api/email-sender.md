### FAQ

**Q1: What is an authorization code/app-specific password?**
A: An authorization code/app-specific password is a special password generated by email service providers to enhance security, used for third-party applications (such as email clients, automation scripts) to log into the mailbox. It cannot be replaced by regular login passwords.

**Q2: Why use authorization codes/app-specific passwords?**
A: After enabling two-factor authentication, regular passwords cannot be directly used for SMTP and other third-party services. Authorization codes/app-specific passwords must be used to ensure account security.

**Q3: What to do if authorization code/app-specific password is lost?**
A: You can regenerate new authorization codes/app-specific passwords in the mailbox security settings at any time, and the old ones can be revoked.

**Q4: What are common reasons for configuration failures?**
A: Common reasons include not enabling SMTP service, not using authorization codes/app-specific passwords, incorrect port/encryption configuration, restricted mailbox login, etc.

For specific issues, it's recommended to consult the official help centers of respective email providers or contact email service customer support.

The `EmailSender` module provides a complete and easy-to-use email sending solution with built-in support for multiple mainstream email service providers.

## Sender Base Class

All concrete senders inherit from the `EmailSender` abstract base class.

::: email_widget.email_sender.EmailSender
    options:
        show_root_heading: true
        show_source: false
        heading_level: 3

## Factory Function

For convenience, we recommend using the `create_email_sender` factory function to create sender instances.

::: email_widget.email_sender.create_email_sender
    options:
        show_root_heading: true
        show_source: false
        heading_level: 3

## Concrete Implementations

Below are specific implementation classes for different email service providers. Usually you only need to use them through the factory function.

### QQEmailSender

::: email_widget.email_sender.QQEmailSender
    options:
        show_root_heading: false
        heading_level: 4
